# This file tells the frr package which daemons to start.

	##### FRROUTING

# FRRouting (FRR) is a free and open source Internet routing protocol suite
# for Linux and Unix platforms.
# The FRRouting suite consists of various protocol-specific daemons and a
# protocol-independent daemon called zebra.
# Each of the protocol-specific daemons are responsible for running the
# relevant protocol and building the routing table based on the information
# exchanged.

	##### ZEBRA

# zebra is the daemon that resolves the routes provided by multiple protocols
# and programs these routes in the Linux kernel.
# The FRRouting documentation defines zebra as the IP routing manager for
# FRRouting that “provides kernel routing table updates, interface lookups,
# and redistribution of routes between different routing protocols.”
# The zebra daemon is enabled by default. You can enable the other daemons
# according to how you plan to route your network.

# All the routing protocol daemons (bgpd, ospfd, isisd) are dependent on zebra.
# When you start FFRouting, systemd determines whether zebra is running; if
# zebra is not running, systemd starts zebra, then starts the dependent service,
# such as bgpd.

	##### BGPD

# bgpd is a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) daemon which manages the network
# routing tables. Its main purpose is to exchange information concerning
# "network reachability" with other BGP systems.
# BGP is an exterior gateway protocol using a multiple step decision process
# to find the best path.
# The route decision process selects the best path by evaluating all paths
# to the same destination. The decision process continues to the next step
# if paths have equal attributes. Paths that are less preferred are taken out
# of consideration until there is only one path left.

	##### OSPFD

# ospfd is an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) daemon which manages routing tables.
# OSPF is an interior gateway protocol designed to supersede
# RIP (Routing Information Protocol). It has several
# advantages over RIP. For instance, every router has an understanding of the
# complete network topology. Response to changes in the network is faster.
# Furthermore, failure detection is improved.

	##### ISISD

# ISIS is a routing protocol. Compared with RIP, ISIS can provide scalable network
# support and faster convergence times like OSPF.
# isisd needs to acquire interface information from zebra in order to function.
# Therefore zebra must be running before invoking isisd.
# Like other daemons, isisd configuration is done in ISIS specific
# configuration file isisd.conf.

	##### BUSYBOX

# BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
# small executable.
# It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU
# fileutils, shellutils, etc.
# BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any small or embedded system.
# BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in mind.
